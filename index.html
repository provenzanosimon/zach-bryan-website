            <h3>Who Is Zach Bryan?</h3>

            <p>
                Zach Bryan is an American singer-songwriter known for his raw,
                emotional storytelling and stripped-down sound. He gained popularity
                by uploading homemade recordings online rather than following
                traditional music industry paths.
            </p>

            <p>
                His music often focuses on personal experiences, relationships,
                and small-town life, which has helped him connect with a wide
                audience across different age groups.
