            <p>
                Zach Bryan's music blends elements of country, folk, and American.
                His songs are typically simple in structure, allowing the lyrics
                and emotion to take center stage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of heavy studio production, he often uses acoustic instruments
                and natural vocals to keep his sound authentic and relatable.
